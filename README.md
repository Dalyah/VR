In a forest environment, the player will be looking for the correct path to reach the goal (end of the game) in a limited time. 
The player can get help from the signs in the forest to know if he is in the correct path. Simply, the player needs to solve the 
logic problems presented on the signs. If the result is true,  the player is in his right path toward the goal. 
Otherwise, the player needs to change the path.
